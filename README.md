# Life-Expectancy-Insights-and-Prediction

## Description
Life expectancy is a crucial aspect for every individual as it influences the decisions they make throughout their lives. By knowing their life expectancy, individuals can plan their finances, healthcare, retirement, and other aspects of their lives. Therefore, it is important for us to understand and be aware of someone's life expectancy.

An individual's life expectancy is influenced by factors beyond genetics or inherent factors. Factors such as environment, social conditions, and behavior also play a significant role in determining one's life expectancy. For example, access to healthcare services, proper nutrition, and clean water have a significant impact on life expectancy, as well as lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity levels. All these factors work together to influence an individual's life expectancy.

Considering the numerous benefits that can be gained by knowing someone's life expectancy, this research aims to gain a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to determining an individual's life expectancy. With a better understanding of these factors, individuals can make better decisions in facing their lives.

## Objectives
The general objective of this research is to create a model capable of predicting an individual's life expectancy and understanding the various factors that influence life expectancy.

The specific objectives of this research are as follows:
* To answer the following question: Which region and country had the largest population in 2015?
* Is life expectancy lower in developing countries compared to developed countries?
* What are the three most influential factors on life expectancy?
* Is there a correlation between alcohol consumption, HIV incidence rate, education duration, and life expectancy?
* What is the best approach that can be used to predict life expectancy?
* How accurate is the best model?
